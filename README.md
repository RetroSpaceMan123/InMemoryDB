# In-Memory Database Demo
This is my submission for the In-Memory Database extra credit assignment for CIS4930 : Enterprise Software Engineering Practices @ UF

## How to Run
1. Compile the code with the command ```javac InMemoryDBDemo.java``` in the main project folder.
2. Run the demo with the command ```java InMemoryDBDemo```
3. Run the command ```help``` once the demo begins to get all possible commands

## How to Improve the Assignment in the Future
For the assignment in the future, it should be clearer as to how this program is supposed to be demoed. For example, the in-line database is implemented as a command-line prompt, however, the example code is written as if the program is supposed to be a library for another program. For grading, I think it might be a neat idea to have the in-memory database be implemented as a backend server, so that an automatic grader could be written to grade the assignment based on the responses the grader gets from the server.
